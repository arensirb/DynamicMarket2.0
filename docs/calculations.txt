[BasePrice]
This is the baseline buying price for an item. The current buying and selling prices are based on this.
This price is for one bundle, which contains the number of items in <bundleSize>. (Stored in the database in the "count" field)
The BasePrice equals the buying price of 1 bundle at Stock = 0.

[Stock]
This is an integer representing the current stock level (in bundles).
This can be interpreted as a "relative offset" of inventory, in which case Stock can be positive or negative, and indicates the amount over or under an "average" inventory level.
This can also be interpreted as an "absolute count" of inventory, by setting StockLowest = 0. Either way, the following calculations work the same.

[Volatility]
This is a measure of how rapidly an item's price changes as the result of a change in the stock level.
Corresponds to the percent increase in price per reduction of stock by 1 bundle, multiplied by 10,000.
This value can range from 1 (-1 stock -> +0.01% price) to 10000 (-1 stock -> +100% price)

[Inverse Volatility]
This is a measure of how many bundles the stock level must be reduced by to double the current price.
This is not actually stored internally, but is provided as a convenience; InverseVolatility is converted to Volatility on entry.
This value can range from 1 (Volatility = 10000, -1 stock -> +100% price) to about 6900 (Volatility = 1, -6900 stock -> +100% price)

[SalesTax]
This is the difference between the current buying and selling prices for an item, expressed as a percentage scaled by 100.
SellPrice = BuyPrice * (1 - (SalesTax / 100))
So, if SalesTax = 0, SellPrice = BuyPrice.
If SalesTax = 35, SellPrice = BuyPrice - 35% (or BuyPrice * 0.65).
The SalesTax is applied after all other calculations involved in generating the BuyPrice.
