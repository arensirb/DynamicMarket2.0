items-db-path=
    Path to the items.db file SimpleMarket will use to get initial item names. Default: "/Plugins/SimpleMarket/"
shop-tag=
    Default prefix for messages from the Shop plugin. (Not always used... will become more universal.)
max-items-per-purchase=
    Maximum number of items (not bundles) which can be purchased in a single transaction.
max-items-per-sale=
    Maximum number of items (not bundles) which can be sold in a single transaction.
database-type=
    Type of database used to store shop items.
Valid values are "sqlite" (default) and "mysql".
Anything other than "mysql" will be considered to be "sqlite".
csv-file=
    The file name of the .csv file used for shop database importing/exporting. (May have the shop label auto-prefixed to the name, if supplied by a wrapper plugin.)
csv-file-path=
    The path to the .csv file.
simple-permissions=
    If set to "true", then the Permissions plugin will not be used. Instead, DynamicMarket will assume that any commands
coming from a logged-in player have "normal user" access ("list", "buy", "sell", "help", etc.), and any commands coming from the Bukkit console
have "admin" access ("add", "update", "exportDB", etc.).
text-colour-normal=
text-colour-command=
text-colour-bracket=
text-colour-param=
text-colour-error=
    Sets the colour codes used for various text highlights. These are single-character strings in [0..9]|[a..f], without "&"s or other control characters.

The following settings are only used if "database-type=mysql":
mysql-db=
    The database connection string for your MySQL database, if used. Default is "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/minecraft"
mysql-user=
    The user name used to connect to your MySQL database.
mysql-pass=
    The password used to connect to your MySQL database.
mysql-dbengine=
    The database engine used to create your MySQL database table.
Recommended values are "MyISAM" (default) and "InnoDB".
A good discussion of the differences can be found here.
Only used when the shop database is created or reset.

The following settings are used for integrating DynamicMarket with another plugin:
wrapper-mode=
    If set to "true", then DynamicMarket will not handle commands typed in by a player or from the console. Instead, it will expect
commands to be passed in by another plugin, which serves as the "wrapper".
wrapper-permissions=
    If set to "true", then DynamicMarket will expect another plugin to register a permission handler with DynamicMarket.
That plugin will then be able to handle any permission queries DynamicMarket needs to make. "simple-permissions=true" will override this.
